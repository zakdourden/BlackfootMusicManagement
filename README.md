# BlackfootMusicManagement
This is the completed form of the Blackfoot music inventory management system.
It uses a python micro framework flask, which I absolutly enjoyed using. 
I tried to make the project farily modular using blueprints to seperate the app
into parent and teacher applications. The app works for what it is suppose to do and 
show cases the ease of using flask. Initially this app uses flask mysql using straight
SQL instead of using a helpful library like SQLAlchemy. If I revist Flask I will take steps 
to seperate the model and controller futher and use SQLAlchemy.
