The following SQL Tables are part of the Schema: mydb
In order to work this python project on another machine simply create the following:
 
Schema (or database): mydb
add the following tables in this directory
-->gradelevel
-->instrument
-->parent
-->parentstudent
-->permissions
-->student
-->teacher

With these tables added and a schema called mydb the project should work out of the box
unless: mysql has a password to reach schmea. Something has been miss named.
